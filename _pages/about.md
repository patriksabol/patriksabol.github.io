I'm a Machine Learning Developer specializing in **geospatial computer vision** and **AI foundation models**. Currently working at Geodeticca Vision, I lead technical development on major European projects including the FFplus Innovation Study for geospatial analysis using HPC infrastructure, and the AERODROMATION project for ESA focused on automating airport mapping from satellite imagery.

With a **PhD in Artificial Intelligence** from Technical University of Košice, I bring expertise in developing production-ready ML systems—from research and model training on cloud/HPC infrastructure to deployment using modern MLOps practices. My work spans **PyTorch-based model development**, **Kubernetes deployments**, and **scalable geospatial data processing**.

## Professional Services

I'm available for freelance work in:

- **Machine Learning Development**: Custom ML models for computer vision, NLP, and specialized domains
- **Mobile App Development**: Cross-platform applications using Flutter
- **MLOps & Deployment**: Production ML systems with Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms
- **Geospatial AI**: Satellite/aerial imagery analysis, foundation models, and topological data extraction

Feel free to reach out via email or phone for collaboration opportunities.
